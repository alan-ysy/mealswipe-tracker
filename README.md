# CWRU Meal Swipe Tracker
A web application to help CWRU students keep track of their meal swipes.

## Description
Currently, the only option CWRU provides for keeping track of your meal swipes is the eAccounts webpage or app. However, I find these options unintuitive and inconvenient to use for the following reasons:
- The webpage that shows swipes is difficult to find and hard to navigate
- Both the webpage and app list swipes by "Period," which isn't very descriptive

The goal of this application is to provide a simpler, more accessible way for students to keep track of their meal swipes.
## Planned Features
- Simple, intuitive UI for checking and logging swipes
- Backend for storing and syncing user data across devices
- Accessibility and improvements in mobile usability

## Limitations
Swipes must be logged manually since this application does not connect to university dining services.
